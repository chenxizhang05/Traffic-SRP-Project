Street network models are used in global cities to predict the movement of poisonous gas in
urban areas based on the geometric properties of the street layouts. Our project’s aim is to develop a
street network model to simplify the computationally expensive procedures and predict the dispersion of
gases in cities. Our project begins with an initial street network of buildings, whereby the roads are
modelled to be the perpendicular bisectors between the building surfaces. We aim to improve the
preliminary layout by making the intersections cleaner and the roads straighter to more effectively
model the dispersion of gas. Existing research in this field includes Geoff Boeing’s global street network
model and the open-source OSMnx library he designed to analyse the street networks of urban areas.[1]
We were inspired by his paper in both its methodology and the indexes he used to quantify the
conditions of the roads, which determined our approaches to improve the initial street network.
